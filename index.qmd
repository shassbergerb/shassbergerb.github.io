# About Me

I am Brent Shassberger, a current PhD Student at Case Western Reserve University and future Virologist! Although I am a Cleveland native, my undergraduate studies brought me to the University of Miami (FL), where I received my B.S. in Microbiology and Immunology. After earning my B.S., I continued my education, this time pursing a Master's degree in Pathology at CWRU. During this time, I joined the lab of Dr. Anna Bruchez, PhD, and studied two human genes that *may* impact Ebola virus infection: Chloride Channel 3 and TGF-$\beta$ Receptor Associated Protein 1 (TGFBRAP1).
