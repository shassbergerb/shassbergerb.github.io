I was always mystified by the microscopic world and how creatures 1000x smaller than us could cause disease. Once the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic started, I took an interest in Epidemiology as I started to appreciate the role human behavior has in infectious disease.\nAfter graduating from Miami, I attended Case Western Reserve University to pursue a Masters in Pathology in order to continue my education and acquire research experience. I would eventually join the lab of Dr. Anna Bruchez to follow up on some of her previous findings in cellular factors that can inhibit Ebola Virus entry. I worked with Dr. Bruchez for a year until I decided to switch from the Masters in Pathology program to the university’s PhD program : the Biomedical Sciences Training Program (BSTP).\nNow in the BSTP, I have decided to join a close collaborator of Dr. Bruchez, Dr. Kenneth Matreyek for my doctoral training and thesis project."

Since I have joined the BSTP, another student has taken over this project and we are working towards publishing some of the preliminary data.\nAs a requirement in the BSTP, I have only just joined the lab that I will complete my thesis in this December and have not had enough time to decide a project for my thesis."

Although I am a Cleveland native, my undergraduate studies brought me to the University of Miami (FL), where I received my B.S. in Microbiology and Immunology. After earning my B.S., I continued my education, this time pursing a Master’s degree in Pathology at CWRU. During this time, I joined the lab of Dr. Anna Bruchez, PhD, and studied two human genes that may impact Ebola virus infection: Chloride Channel 3 and TGF-\\(\\beta\\) Receptor Associated Protein 1 (TGFBRAP1)."

    "text": "arXiv Preprint | Code\nOver the centuries, I have devoted countless hours to deciphering and translating the ancient scripts and dialects of the various peoples of Middle-earth. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."
